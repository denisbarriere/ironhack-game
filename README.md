A javascript version of an awesome iOS puzzle where you need to flip tiles to make colour matches to move through the levels. 

This project was built in **native Javascript** and **jQuery**, as part of the **Ironhack Web Development Bootcamp in Barcelona** (at week 3 of the program). The MVP was released in **one week** with only one level available optimised for mobile (supporting swipe gestures).
I later added 4 extra levels, refactored / clean-up the code and optimised it for desktop

There are a lot of things I would like to implement  improve. All these stories / defects are listed in a Trello board I can share.

Here is a quick presentation of the project made for the demo day: [slides.com](https://slides.com/denisbarriere/m-y-f-o-l-t/live#)

Finally, the project is deployed to GitHub Pages and is accessible [here](https://denisbarriere.github.io/ironhack-game)
